# Acceptance Criteria

**Project:** Aircraft Predictive Maintenance & Fleet Availability
**Problem statement:** PS 26249
**Repository location:** `docs/product/acceptance_criteria.md`
**Status:** Acceptance specification; original full release remains incomplete. Individual implemented checks and retained results are recorded in [project status](../team/project_status.md), [release readiness](../operations/production_readiness.md) and [UI verification](../design/ui_verification.md); this specification is not a completed release acceptance record.
**Related documents:** `intent.md`, `scope.md`, `docs/product/feature_specifications.md`

## 1. How Acceptance Works

This document defines evidence required to accept the scoped demonstrator. Planned capability, implemented capability and validated capability are distinct.

Each criterion receives one status: **not run**, **passed**, **failed**, or **blocked**. A blocked or unrun required criterion does not count as passed. Associate results with a source revision and the exact input/configuration versions used.

Passing functional checks does not establish predictive accuracy, simulation validity or operational suitability. Scientific claims require their own evaluations. The release remains a demonstrator using supported engine data and labelled logistics assumptions.

### Evidence record

For each criterion, retain:

- Criterion identifier and status.
- Source revision, environment and relevant versions.
- Input/fixture/dataset/configuration identifiers and hashes where applicable.
- Test or evaluation command and output artifact.
- Actual outcome and comparison with the required condition.
- Limitations, failures or unresolved dependencies.

Machine-verifiable checks should retain machine-readable results. Screenshots or walkthrough recordings demonstrate interface behaviour but do not substitute for constraint, concurrency or leakage checks.

## 2. Evaluation Decisions Required Before Testing

The following values are not invented here. Define them in the referenced protocol, version that decision, and freeze it before the corresponding final evaluation.

| Decision | Required specification | Owning document |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset support | Subsets/regimes, engine partitions, target definition/capping, cutoff/window rules and preprocessing. | `docs/research/dataset_protocol.md` |
| Prediction acceptance | Baselines, error metrics, late-prediction penalty, aggregation, repetitions and an application-relevant acceptable error bound. | `docs/research/evaluation_protocol.md` |
| Uncertainty acceptance | Nominal interval level, calibration procedure, coverage tolerance, acceptable width, groups and sufficient sample criteria. | Evaluation protocol |
| Alert acceptance | Policy thresholds/margins, event definition, warning horizon, false/missed-event budgets and schedule-change comparison. | Evaluation protocol and alert configuration |
| Planner acceptance | Instance families, units/discretization, objectives, baseline, time limit and required quality/runtime. | Evaluation protocol and scheduling configuration |
| Simulation acceptance | State definitions, usage/repair/logistics assumptions, replications, comparison metrics and sampling procedure. | `docs/research/simulation_assumptions.md` and evaluation protocol |
| Responsiveness | Target hardware/browser, dataset/visible-chart size, user concurrency, concurrent jobs and latency/resource budgets. | Acceptance benchmark configuration linked from evaluation protocol |

Decisions may be informed by training/validation experiments or stakeholder needs. Do not choose thresholds after inspecting the final test outcomes merely to make a result pass. A changed protocol requires a separately identified evaluation and an honest account of previously inspected data.

## 3. F01 — Unified Records

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F01-01 | Supported valid imports produce correct component/observation/task relationships and source/unit metadata. | Import fixture checks and database/API assertions. |
| AC-F01-02 | Reimporting an identical source/version does not duplicate observations or tasks; conflicting existing values follow the documented correction policy. | Repeated/conflicting import tests and provenance history. |
| AC-F01-03 | Malformed identities, invalid cycles/times and unsupported units are rejected or explicitly reported under the configured partial-import policy. | Invalid-input cases and accepted/rejected counts. |
| AC-F01-04 | A displayed assessment or proposal links to its actual input snapshot; later corrections do not silently rewrite historical evidence. | Versioned correction and retrieval checks. |

## 4. F02 — Life Prediction and Uncertainty

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F02-01 | Engine identities do not leak across required disjoint partitions; fit transformations use only permitted training data. | Split manifests, transformation provenance and leakage checks. |
| AC-F02-02 | Training and serving apply the same versioned transformation, feature ordering, units and target definition. | Parity check on a fixed input with an explicit numerical tolerance. |
| AC-F02-03 | Historical replay cannot consume observations beyond the selected cutoff or future target labels. | Cutoff tests, including modifications to future observations that leave current inputs unchanged. |
| AC-F02-04 | Classical and sequence candidates are evaluated under the same protocol; the selected model meets the predeclared error requirements. | Held-out metrics and subgroup/repeated-run results where specified. |
| AC-F02-05 | Intervals meet the predeclared coverage/width requirements on eligible evaluation groups; insufficiently supported groups are disclosed. | Coverage, width and sample-count reports with calibration provenance. |
| AC-F02-06 | Results contain model/input/calibration versions and quality state; invalid or unsupported results are qualified/withheld by the defined policy. | API/output validation and model-support cases. |

Do not require a neural model to beat a classical model. If the baseline is stronger, it may be selected. If no candidate meets the declared quality requirements, this feature is blocked for its claimed support boundary; revise the scope or method explicitly rather than fabricate success.

## 5. F03 — Prediction Evidence

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F03-01 | Evidence charts, influences, cutoff and provenance belong to the same assessment/input version. | Version-alignment assertions and a reviewed evidence card. |
| AC-F03-02 | Units, missing/imputed values and known limitations are visible; unknown physical sensor mappings remain labelled as such. | Interface walkthrough and metadata cases. |
| AC-F03-03 | The chosen explanation method is evaluated under the declared stability/fidelity checks and its limitations are recorded. | Explanation evaluation, reference/baseline definition and examples. |
| AC-F03-04 | Unsupported/failed explanation generation produces an explicit unavailable state without invented fault causes or a misleading narrative. | Failure/unsupported cases. |

## 6. F04 — Stable Alerts

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F04-01 | Alert state changes match the versioned policy, including persistence/hysteresis and chronological input rules. | Fixed-history reference cases. |
| AC-F04-02 | Repeated assessment/event delivery does not duplicate transitions; acknowledgement does not resolve deterioration. | Deduplication and review-state tests. |
| AC-F04-03 | Invalid/withheld assessments do not silently clear an active health concern; overdue mandatory work stays visible. | Degraded-data and mandatory-task cases. |
| AC-F04-04 | The selected policy meets the frozen alert budgets and is compared with a threshold baseline. | Warning time, missed/false-event and recommendation-change reports. |

Alert stability alone is insufficient: reducing changes while increasing missed events beyond the accepted budget fails the policy requirement.

## 7. F05 — Maintenance Planner

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F05-01 | Every proposal presented as usable passes independent checks for mandatory deadlines, capacity/qualifications, precedence, parts timing and fixed commitments. | Validator outputs for representative and boundary instances. |
| AC-F05-02 | Invalid inputs are distinguished from mathematical infeasibility, execution failure and time-limit/unknown outcomes. | Controlled cases for each exposed outcome. |
| AC-F05-03 | Feasible and optimal labels match solver status; objective/bounds and settings are retained when available. | Solver-result contract checks. |
| AC-F05-04 | Revising a task/resource/assumption creates a new proposal version; editing a timeline cannot bypass validation. | Revision and edit/revalidation tests. |
| AC-F05-05 | The planner meets its declared runtime/quality requirements and is compared against a defined baseline on common instances. | Benchmark manifest, objectives, statuses and runtimes. |

Hard-constraint violations in any accepted proposal fail acceptance. A small-instance feasibility check does not prove all possible schedules are correct; retain the tested scope and use validation on every returned proposal.

## 8. F06 — Grouping and Inventory

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F06-01 | Grouped tasks satisfy documented compatibility, windows, duration and resource constraints; grouping benefits/tradeoffs are reported honestly. | Grouping reference cases and comparison with separate work. |
| AC-F06-02 | Unapproved proposals do not consume/reserve stock; approved plans reserve exactly their required quantities. | Stock/reservation assertions before and after approval. |
| AC-F06-03 | Concurrent requests for insufficient shared stock cannot double-reserve it; failed approval does not leave a partial commitment. | Concurrent transaction and rollback tests. |
| AC-F06-04 | Cancellation/revision releases only eligible reservations; previously consumed parts are not automatically recreated. | Reservation lifecycle cases. |
| AC-F06-05 | Shortage quantities, arrivals and inventory corrections are traceable to actual fixture/record versions and authorized changes. | Bottleneck and audit checks. |

## 9. F07 — Availability Simulation

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F07-01 | Small deterministic reference cases produce expected grounding/waiting/completion states and metrics within defined tolerances. | Analytically understandable cases and event traces. |
| AC-F07-02 | Resource occupancy respects capacity and aircraft/component state transitions remain consistent. | Simulation invariants, including simultaneous-event cases. |
| AC-F07-03 | Each run records scenario/policy/model versions, horizon, state/metric definitions, usage conversions and sampling settings. | Run manifest inspection. |
| AC-F07-04 | Alternative policies use comparable inputs and the declared sampling procedure; mismatch is blocked or prominently qualified. | Comparison contracts and paired-scenario checks. |
| AC-F07-05 | Stochastic results report the declared replication summaries/variability; deterministic results have no fabricated uncertainty. | Per-run and aggregated outputs. |
| AC-F07-06 | Outputs are labelled simulated projections; repair/reset effectiveness and synthetic logistics assumptions are inspectable. | Interface review and assumption links. |

No fixed availability improvement is assumed. A worse-performing plan must remain visible as such. If claiming improvement, report the baseline, scenarios, repetitions, variability and scope supporting the claim; do not generalize it to an actual fleet.

## 10. F08 — Data Quality and Robustness

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-F08-01 | Declared checks detect their defined missing/invalid/stale/out-of-order conditions and retain interpretable findings. | Quality-rule fixtures, including valid edge cases. |
| AC-F08-02 | Imputed values remain distinguishable from observations; qualified/withheld states match the policy. | Transformation and assessment-output checks. |
| AC-F08-03 | A withheld assessment cannot silently provide numerical planning input or healthy status; mandatory tasks remain actionable. | Cross-feature degraded-data workflow. |
| AC-F08-04 | Missingness/noise/regime robustness experiments meet the declared support requirements or explicitly narrow the support boundary. | Error/coverage/withholding results for each intervention. |

Do not claim universal out-of-distribution detection. The supported checks, their evaluation and limitations define the feature's acceptance boundary.

## 11. Supporting Workflow and Reliability

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-S01 | Permissions are enforced server-side; unauthorized viewing/editing/approval is rejected without unintended state changes. | Permission matrix cases. |
| AC-S02 | Approval rechecks current plan/task/stock/resource versions. Stale proposals produce a conflict, not silent approval of changed content. | Competing edit/approval cases. |
| AC-S03 | Repeated approval requests do not duplicate work records or reservations; material decisions retain user/time/version evidence. | Idempotency and audit assertions. |
| AC-S04 | Partial work completion, part consumption and remaining tasks are represented correctly; historical assessments remain unchanged. | Completion lifecycle cases. |
| AC-S05 | Killing/restarting an API or worker produces a recoverable job or explicit failure, with no silently lost recorded job. | Fault-injection recovery record. |
| AC-S06 | Repeated messages/retries cannot duplicate accepted effects; superseded attempts cannot replace the authoritative result. | Retry/deduplication/stale-result cases. |
| AC-S07 | Interrupted dispatch is recoverable under the outbox design; success is announced only after durable result persistence. | Dispatch interruption and completion-order tests. |
| AC-S08 | Cancellation-requested and cancelled states are distinct; late results follow the declared cancellation policy. | Cancellation race cases. |
| AC-S09 | Reconnecting clients can retrieve authoritative job/results independently of live events; replay does not duplicate UI state. | Connection interruption and state-retrieval tests. |

## 12. Interface, Reproducibility and Responsiveness

| ID | Required condition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-X01 | Principal screens handle loading, empty, error/unavailable, stale and denied states without plausible-looking substitute outputs. | State walkthrough and applicable E2E checks. |
| AC-X02 | Core actions work with keyboard navigation; focus is usable; warnings/statuses have text labels and are not colour-only. | Keyboard/focus review and automated checks where useful. |
| AC-X03 | Chart units, cutoffs, selected components and provenance stay consistent across linked views. | Linked-interaction checks. |
| AC-X04 | Repeated evaluation with the retained environment/configuration reproduces required outcomes within declared tolerances. | Reproduction commands and comparison outputs. |
| AC-X05 | API/worker isolation and UI responsiveness meet the declared budgets under the declared workload/hardware. | Latency/resource/error reports while calculations run. |
| AC-X06 | Public API/client contracts match the implemented schema; migrations and a representative restoration preserve required relationships/results. | Contract generation checks, migration/restore record. |

Reproducibility is evaluated within the declared environment. Do not promise identical floating-point outputs across every machine or library release. A restored database must retain resolvable artifact references; database backup alone may not preserve model/data files.

## 13. End-to-End Release Gate

The release walkthrough must complete these connected cases using the tested source revision:

1. Import supported engine history and labelled fleet/logistics inputs.
2. Replay a held-out engine without future-input leakage.
3. Inspect assessment, interval, evidence and alert history.
4. Generate a checked proposal exposing a known parts/resource constraint.
5. Revise one logistical assumption and retain separate proposal versions.
6. Compare alternatives through reproducible, labelled simulation results.
7. Approve a plan with current-state checks and consistent reservations.
8. Record work/completion without rewriting historical evidence.
9. Inject degraded sensor input and observe the specified quality response.
10. Interrupt/recover a calculation and retrieve its authoritative state/result.

Required functional criteria must pass, evaluation decisions must be frozen, and scientific criteria must meet those decisions. Any unrun/blocked requirement must remain explicitly incomplete. A narrowed demonstration requires a deliberate scope/specification change; it must not be labelled the original full release.

## 14. Claims Allowed by Acceptance

Acceptance may support statements about tested records, supported simulated engine predictions, constraint-checked proposals and scenario-specific simulation outcomes.

It does not establish real military fleet improvements, regulatory certification, whole-aircraft diagnosis, guaranteed failure prevention or airworthiness clearance. Competition presentation and documentation must stay within the evidence actually retained.

## Aircraft inspection redesign acceptance

Decision-flow presentation additionally checks default Start routing, API-backed open-work records without an inferred health classification, Start → register → component → planning with retained context, main/supporting navigation grouping and keyboard focus restoration, mobile viewport containment and API failure without a fabricated empty/healthy state. Source-rendered screenshots and browser checks are indexed in UI verification. A participant understanding study remains required separately; route tests are not usability acceptance.

AI visibility checks additionally verify the Fleet explanation/navigation path, `/ai` saved estimate/interval and quality state, selection/reload, component/aircraft and assessment-version alignment, withheld/no-assessment handling, API failure/retry and mobile navigation/containment. Retain labelled-fixture browser evidence separately from live model evaluation and the participant comprehension study. Presentation checks do not close independent alert, explanation-stability or robustness gates.

Verify actual rendered screens, not rewritten specifications alone. Required checks: mapped annotation/list parity; aircraft/component identity reconciliation and delayed-response protection; renderer/model/no-WebGL fallback retaining evidence/actions; history units/cutoff/table alternatives; actual interval metadata and unavailable explanation states; exact-plan approval and stale conflict; versioned supply assumptions preserving prior outcomes; honest job/result status. Capture 1440×900, 1366×768, tablet and mobile, keyboard, reduced-motion and 200% zoom. Record source revision/check scope, actual screenshots, device/browser and asset/orbit measurements in UI verification.

Proposed initial budgets are ≤10 MB compressed model and ≤2K textures, and median orbit frame interval ≤33 ms on the recorded demonstration device. A measured pass on one device is not a cross-device guarantee. Participant comprehension of aircraft/component/evidence/proposal remains to be evaluated. Original public HTTPS, independent complete-history alert evaluation and operator-approved costs/targets remain blocked where prerequisites are absent; this redesign cannot close those gates.

### Customer-trial verification boundary

The local `/demo` journey must retain entered input identities and actual model/plan/run/work results; isolate trial resources from ordinary fleet proposals and other trials; require matching available AI for the trial policy; preserve mandatory deadlines; distinguish expected from received stock; invalidate stale proposals; and reserve/consume parts through existing transactions. Check both insufficient history and an impossible AI-informed window. Browser transitions do not establish participant comprehension, model qualification or full release acceptance. See [customer_trial.md](customer_trial.md) and [UI verification](../design/ui_verification.md).

## Aircraft twin showcase verification

Shared navbar checks compare geometry, glass styling, destination order and header tools across operations, aircraft and research routes at desktop/mobile widths. Menus retain research-tool access, active states and route-close behaviour; mobile supports Escape/focus return. Header tools must not clip or widen the viewport. Authentication screens are outside the workspace shell.

Camera containment must cover arbitrary pointer orbit and interpolated preset angles, not just settled presets. Project the normalized model-bound corners across representative azimuth/elevation/aspect combinations with a safety margin; capture actual pointer drags at desktop/laptop/tablet/mobile sizes. Camera controls and the component toggle must retain at least a 16px desktop gap.

The component-condition drawer must show all components from the selected API response with identity/RUL/evidence parity; support keyboard Enter, Escape and close-trigger focus restoration; navigate to actual evidence; and dismiss when exploring the system map or changing aircraft/replay. Check mobile containment and independently scrollable component content. Modal behaviour is not a full accessibility certification.

The model-first showroom additionally checks selected-record component/evidence link parity after expanding Component condition, returned remaining-life labels, hidden detailed cards on initial load, a separated desktop model/camera-control split, desktop/laptop stage fit and non-overlapping camera/browse controls at all captured widths. History/advisory navigation follows the showroom in visual and DOM order. Still-image references do not prove airframe geometry or engineering accuracy; authorised source geometry/configuration and validation remain prerequisites.

For the decorative flexible grid, verify pointer and camera movement change only the background paths, controls retain input and records/browsing remain usable, the stage remains white with sharp foreground content, and mobile does not widen the page. Reduced motion must retain identical static paths despite pointer/camera changes; component inspection pauses background updates. The layer is accessibility-hidden and not a physical simulation.

The optimized Canvas2D grid must stop drawing when settled/offscreen and remain static under reduced motion; verify this with actual draw counts, not an unchanged image alone. Verify one background renderer per workspace page, stage-specific aircraft rendering without duplication, shared coverage of operations/research pages, mobile raster bounds and unblurred foreground controls/evidence. Compare the same documented active/idle workload before/after optimization and retain measurements; one local profile does not establish universal device performance.

For the approved visual-only fighter, verify the studio requests the authored fighter GLB and not the transport; root provenance declares no engineering validation; front/side/top/three-quarter captures render; generator surfaces have finite vertices/normals and mirrored delta-wing bounds; failure uses the labelled fighter silhouette while retaining records/evidence. Asset generation and unit/browser checks do not establish aerodynamic, dimensional, installation or physical-system accuracy.

Verify studio rendering and side/top/three-quarter controls; forward, reverse, selector, keyboard and model-region wheel browsing; a persistent canvas between aircraft; next-record retrieval/identity checks and input locking; failed/delayed/mismatched response retention; reduced-motion switching; renderer/model failure preserving records and component evidence; and viewport containment at 1440×900, 1366×768, 900×1000 and 390×844. Check usage statistics against the selected API snapshot. Transition screenshots verify reconstructed poses, not exact timing parity with an unavailable reference video. Shared illustrative geometry must not be presented as separate validated airframes. Record executed scope and actual captures in `docs/design/ui_verification.md`.

## Interactive blueprint acceptance

Verify the blueprint follows the aircraft stage before the detail tabs, contains only the selected snapshot's component identities, and matches state/advisory findings without turning missing mappings or maintenance into invented red failures. Check current vs completed advisory handling and all twenty catalogue model mappings. Clicking a drawn assembly or keyboard register entry must open the same component's illustrative structure and API-backed evidence; assembled/exploded/wireframe, camera reset, Escape/focus restoration and evidence routing must work. Verify aircraft/replay changes clear selection, unknown types remain inspectable without a fabricated model, no-WebGL retains records, and desktop/mobile layouts and modal scroll remain contained. Retain actual captures and executed checks; geometry integrity is not engineering accuracy or fault diagnosis.

## Release-v2 evidence status — 2026-10-05

Resource-aware planning, episode behavior, actual-plan replay, PostgreSQL exclusion races, real queue recovery and fresh restore now have executed bounded evidence. Required original scientific stability/robustness/performance decisions, intended-user understanding, external aircraft qualification and public deployment must not be relabelled passed. The detailed eight-workstream ledger is `docs/team/release_acceptance.md`. Completing local engineering checks does not narrow the original release silently.

Verify the aircraft showroom integrates below the floating navbar without a replay row or duplicate System map. Inspect top/front/side 2D projections and all 3D camera presets, cockpit visibility, whole-assembly red material coverage and direct selection without locator circles. Component records/evidence must remain reachable.
