# ADR 0006: Synthetic fleet-health workspace from the PS 26249 plan

Accepted implementation decision, 2026-10-06. Source plan: `hritvikrajmishra/PS26249` `docs/plan.md`.

## Context

The plan asks for nine essential modules on a whole-fleet, multi-system synthetic world: data integration, a fleet dashboard, health monitoring with anomaly detection, a predictive engine (risk, RUL, advisories), a software digital twin, spares intelligence, planning and work orders, an availability scenario simulator, and alerts. `scope.md` had excluded whole-aircraft twins and learned spare demand, and the existing release centred on C-MAPSS engine RUL. The product owner asked for the plan to be integrated in full, with a more interactive interface.

## Decision

Add the plan as a **separate, clearly labelled synthetic workspace** beside the C-MAPSS engine lab. Do not replace the lab.

| Plan module | Implementation |
|---|---|
| 1 Data integration | `science/fleet/integration.py`: four source extracts with injected identifier, date-format, duplicate and quality defects, normalised into the aircraft → system → component → part model; validated ingestion endpoint with per-row errors |
| 2 Fleet dashboard | `/dashboard` |
| 3 Health monitoring | condition-normalised residuals, Isolation Forest, sustained-alert rule; `/health/:id` |
| 4 Predictive engine | calibrated 14/30-day risk, quantile RUL with conformal widening, rule-based priority (`priority.yaml`), template explanations |
| 5 Digital twin | roll-up and 120-day replay (`decisions.twin_aircraft`); SVG schematic; global replay control |
| 6 Spares | demand = scheduled + Σ calibrated failure probability vs moving-average baseline; shortfall and lead-time-vs-RUL checks |
| 7 Planning & work orders | advisory status workflow and planned work orders in PostgreSQL; bay Gantt |
| 8 Availability engine | day-step Monte Carlo with common random numbers; four scenario types |
| 9 Alerts | four rules, persisted acknowledgements |
| 10 Analytics | Ai/Ao, MTBF/MTTR, model evaluation against baselines |

Storage follows ADR 0002: the generated world, scores and evaluation are written by a durable `fleet_engine` worker job into a SHA-256-verified artifact bundle. PostgreSQL holds only mutable human decisions (`fleet_*` tables, migration `4171f79fe2a6`). The API never trains or simulates histories.

Substitutions, so that the locked dependency set is unchanged:
- LightGBM is replaced by scikit-learn `HistGradientBoosting*`.
- SHAP is replaced by occlusion attribution on the risk model's log-odds.

Plan roles map to the existing roles: Commander → supervisor, Planner → planner, Technician → engineer/viewer. Existing cookie sessions are kept instead of JWT.

## Consequences and limitations

- Everything is synthetic. Four hero aircraft (AC-017, AC-023, AC-008, AC-031) and the HYD-114 stock follow disclosed scripts (`World.scripted`).
- The model results were measured on a held-out time period and held-out aircraft (engine run of 2026-10-05). They describe this simulator only:
  - 14-day risk: PR-AUC 0.785, against 0.759 for the logistic baseline.
  - RUL near failure: MAE 13.0 days, against 19.9 for the linear baseline.
  - The 10–90 % RUL interval covers 97 % of all rows, but only 64 % within 60 days of failure. This is below the nominal 80 %.
  - The rolling-z anomaly baseline has higher recall but far more false alarms. The detector choice is a trade-off.
- Ingested readings are validated and stored but do not rescore the current bundle.
- Advisory decisions apply only at the latest engine date; replayed dates are read-only. Replay uses the receipts recorded after the replay day, which is a small look-ahead in the spares view.
- Scenario comparisons are bounded synchronous calculations (≤ 500 runs, ≤ 60 days; about 1 s).
- None of this establishes accuracy on real aircraft, operational readiness or airworthiness.

## Validation

- `tests/unit/test_fleet_health.py` covers seed reproducibility, non-negative stock, the missing-data rate, past-only features (leakage), simulator seed reproducibility, monotonic sanity checks for spares and capacity, health and action rules, ID normalisation, and KPI arithmetic against a hand-computed fixture.
- `make backend-check` and `make web-check` pass.
- Every screen was checked in the browser, in both themes, with no console errors.

## Addendum 2026-10-06: role-based flow

The interface is organised around four users and one flow:

1. A maintenance engineer reviews findings (`/review`).
2. A maintenance supervisor schedules the work (`/plan`).
3. Logistics secures the part (`/parts`).
4. The fleet manager sees the resulting availability (`/status`).

`/welcome` explains the flow and lets the user choose a role. Other screens are grouped under "Explore", and the C-MAPSS tools sit under "Research lab".

Scheduling a work order now creates a `fleet_part_requests` row (migration `61a3e0ef5591`). It is created as `reserved` when an unreserved unit is on hand, and as `open` otherwise. Ordered parts (with an ETA) and received parts feed the spare positions and the availability simulation.

There is a new `fleet_manager` role. The parts-request records are tracked decisions; they do not change the synthetic engine bundle.

## Addendum 2026-10-06: supervisor decisions change fleet state

- **Closing an agency repair:** a supervisor can close an open agency work order with "Return to service" (`fleet_recorded_closures`, migration `e11b31b6122f`).
- **Starting planned work:** this grounds the aircraft as scheduled maintenance.
- **Completing work:** this fits a new part (health index 100, no risk) and consumes the reserved spare.

`decisions.effective_aircraft_state` applies these decisions at the latest date to Fleet status, the twin, the heat-grid, backlog, spares and the re-run 30-day forecast. Replayed dates still show the engine's recorded history.

## Addendum 2026-10-07: enterprise UI specification

**Shell and design system**
- The interface follows the seven-screen operations-centre specification.
- Dark is the default theme, using the spec palette: `#0B101E` canvas and `#161D2C` panels. A light theme remains available.
- Visual rules: Roboto Mono for numbers, 4px radius, hard 1px borders and 32px table rows.
- The 48px header carries the official-marks slot, the `[ SYNTHETIC DATA ENVIRONMENT ]` strip and an inline replay slider.
- The 220px sidebar lists the seven screens. The team workflow, alerts, reports, data sources and research lab are kept under collapsible groups, so no earlier feature was removed.

**Decisions**
- **Official marks.** The application does not draw or download the MoD emblem or the DSSC crest. `public/branding/` takes authorised artwork, rendered in monochrome, with a neutral placeholder until it is provided.
- **Displayed values.** Every value is computed by the engine or simulator. The example figures in the UI specification (82%, HI 41, 62% and so on) are not hard-coded, consistent with the rule against invented outputs.
- **Attribution label.** Risk drivers are labelled "occlusion attribution (SHAP substitute)".
- **Bundling saving.** Bundling savings on the Gantt are the overlap between the planned job and the same aircraft's due inspection.
- **New endpoint.** `PATCH /fleet-health/work-orders/{id}/schedule` moves planned work and re-simulates its impact.

## Addendum 2026-10-07: Phase 12 (Project Forge and the cannibalization planner)

**Project Forge (additive print route)**
- Four of the 20 catalogue parts are printable: HYD-020 reservoir and filter, AVN-310 display unit, FUE-031 fuel quantity sensor and ECS-410 cooling pack. They are marked with `additive_printable` in `catalog.py` and in the bundle catalogue. Bundles made before the flag fall back to the catalogue codes. The main hydraulic pump (HYD-114) is not printable.
- When no unit is available for a printable part, `decisions.spare_check` returns the status `additive_print` with a lead time of `PRINT_DAYS` (1 day). The supplier lead time is kept as `supplier_lead_time_days`. Lead time is not flagged as exceeding the RUL.
- The same 1-day route applies to the advisory spare wait, inventory status (`print`), parts-request ETAs and the Monte Carlo simulator. Print time has no supplier noise and still applies when a scenario makes the supplier unavailable.
- The UI wording is "Supply bypassed: additive print route (1 day)" and "[ ADDITIVE PRINT ROUTE · 1 DAY ]". The specification's "G-Code Sent / DISPATCHED" is not used, because nothing is sent to a printer.

**Cannibalization planner**
- `science/fleet/cannibalize.py` serves `GET /fleet-health/engine/cannibalize-strategy?as_of=`. It is read-only and records nothing.
- **Recipients** are grounded aircraft blocked only by a missing part. That means agency work in the awaiting-spares phase, or started workspace work whose part request is still open or ordered.
- **Donors** are other grounded aircraft. Only healthy units with health index 80 or more, not under work, are used. Mission-capable aircraft are never robbed.
- **Printable parts** are printed rather than robbed, and parts arriving through supply within 3 days are not robbed.
- **Greedy order:** aircraft needing the fewest parts first, removals concentrated on donors already robbed, then the cheapest swap.
- **Exact check:** every recipient subset with a Hungarian least-labour assignment (scipy), up to 14 recipients. If the exact plan unblocks more aircraft or uses less labour, it is returned instead, and `plan_source` says which was used.
- On random adversarial cases, greedy matched the optimum in 78% of 500 instances. It matched on every replay day checked in the synthetic fleet.
- **Labour is an assumption:** removal and fitting each take 25% of the type's repair effort, at 16 man-hours per repair day. A cross-base move adds 6 h.
- Unblocked aircraft still need their bay time. Each donor then waits for that part through normal supply, and the response reports that wait.

## Addendum 2026-10-07: glass navigation and light palette

This supersedes the enterprise shell geometry and the dark default described above. All screens, features and data are unchanged.

- **Navigation.** The 220px sidebar is gone. The header holds:
  - a frosted pill bar with the seven screens, shortened to Overview, Aircraft, Components, Predictive, Bays, Spares and Simulator;
  - "Workflow" and "More" pill menus for the team steps and supporting views;
  - round search, theme, alerts and profile buttons.
- **Context bar.** A slim bar under the header carries the synthetic-data label, the API state and the replay slider. The synthetic-data label stays visible on phones.
- **Phones.** Below 1240px the pills collapse into a glass menu sheet.
- **Palette.**
  - Light is the default: off-white canvas, white 18px-radius cards, green accent `#34b36a`, blue `#3e86f5` for planned work, red and amber for risk.
  - Dark is a graphite variant with the same hues.
  - Colour values that were hard-coded in charts and CSS now read the theme tokens.
- **Charts.** Smoothed green lines with gradient fills, grey comparison bars, faint solid gridlines and frosted tooltips.
- **Glass popups.** Menus, alerts, profile, command palette, modals, drawers, toasts and chart tooltips use `backdrop-filter`.
  - Write `backdrop-filter` unprefixed. The build adds the `-webkit-` form; with both written by hand, the minifier kept only the prefixed one, which Chrome ignores.
  - Header blur sits on pseudo-elements, so popups inside the header can blur the page.
- **Bay flow.** The Bays screen adds a diagram above the timeline, built from the same schedule data:
  - each bay is a panel whose lit cells show elapsed share of its planned bay time;
  - coloured lines run to the aircraft in each bay;
  - aircraft waiting for a bay or a part hang off each agency line on animated amber lines;
  - a bay list with progress bars and a glass detail card complete the view.
