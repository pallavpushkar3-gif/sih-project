# Aircraft reference comparison — 2026-10-09

The user supplied three still images: an AeroTwin inspection workspace, the prior FleetAvail delivery, and a BMW model showroom. These images establish visual direction, not engineering geometry, operating data, animation timing or a validated aircraft configuration.

| Area | Supplied reference | Previous delivery | Current implementation / remaining difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Composition | AeroTwin: large model left, condition evidence right | Tall showroom card; evidence below the fold | Compact model/evidence split; mobile stacks the evidence below the model |
| Header | AeroTwin: compact flat header | Large floating glass header and repeated title spacing | Aircraft-only spacing compressed; shared glass navigation retained as previously requested |
| Model framing | BMW: dominant model, clear silhouette and reflections | Small, washed-out transport front view | Larger three-quarter framing and an authored Tejas-inspired fighter with cockpit/intakes/exhaust/gear/surface detail, following explicit approval of a visual-only model |
| Background | AeroTwin: pale neutral stage; BMW: dark studio | White aircraft against white stage | Pale neutral model stage, white evidence and statistics; no black background or content blur |
| Condition evidence | Engine remaining-life cards and explanations | Aircraft statistics only above system details | Up to three actual selected-aircraft components, ranked by condition/health, with health, returned remaining-life semantics and evidence links |
| Data claims | Reference shows named engines, flights and a 95% label | Synthetic fleet record | Keep actual synthetic component identities/units; do not copy reference numbers, sensor causes or unsupported confidence claims |
| Controls | Compact view controls, aircraft selection and replay | Large vertical browse rail and bottom controls | Compact browsing/camera controls; existing aircraft retrieval locks, identity checks, replay and reduced-motion behavior preserved |
| Engineering fidelity | Fighter-like geometry visible; source accuracy not provided | Licensed generic transport, explicitly illustrative | **Not delivered:** no approved airframe CAD/configuration/mappings/tolerances or validation source exists. Lighting/layout changes cannot establish engineering accuracy |
| Exact parity | Screenshots only; two references have different compositions/colors | Different aircraft and navigation | Reference-inspired layout, not pixel-identical reproduction; retain FleetAvail identity, useful navigation, truthful provenance and responsive behavior |

## Engineering model acceptance prerequisites

A chosen airframe and authorised, configuration-controlled source geometry are required, along with units, revision, component installation mappings, intended accuracy/tolerances and a validation process against the authoritative source. If internal mechanics or physics behavior are requested, they need their own documented parameters and validation evidence. A visual GLB or screenshot alone cannot satisfy those requirements. The approved illustrative fighter is delivered; validated subsystem installation, engineering accuracy, airworthiness and MoD production qualification are not claimed.

## Verification

## Latest showroom references

The subsequent Toyota, collectcar and annotated placement images supersede the always-visible AeroTwin evidence split. The opening composition now has a dominant three-quarter fighter on a light studio stage (Toyota framing), prominent aircraft identity and four quiet lower-band statistics (collectcar hierarchy), and a compact right-side camera-control rail (annotated placement). No automotive color configurator, shopping controls, black backdrop or invented aircraft specifications were copied. Detailed component evidence is expandable; History/Advisories and system details follow the showroom instead of adding navigation bands above the model. The existing shared glass header and small synthetic/replay context remain. This is a responsive adaptation of still-image references, not pixel-exact parity.

Executed checks and actual rendered captures are recorded in [UI verification](ui_verification.md). The new authored fighter GLB replaces the studio's transport model and adds visual geometric detail, not scientific or engineering validation. Its source/export command and measurements are recorded in the asset register. Original legacy transport bytes/licence remain preserved.
