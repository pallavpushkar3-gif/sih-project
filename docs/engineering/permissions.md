# Access and Permissions

Status: single-workspace server sessions and demo identity injection implemented. External identity federation, multi-role accounts and tenant/record isolation are not implemented.

| Role | Implemented mutations |
|---|---|
| viewer | None; read protected workspace records. |
| fleet_manager | Run fleet-health what-if scenarios; acknowledge alerts. |
| engineer | Import supported engine histories, request assessments, acknowledge alerts. |
| planner | Submit planning/simulation jobs and create/revise proposals/scenarios. |
| logistics | Version-checked, audited stock adjustments. |
| supervisor | Engineer/planner/logistics actions plus approval, rejection and work outcomes. |
| administrator | Controlled model registration and labelled workspace fixture imports; no implicit operational approval. |

Every protected router authenticates on the server. Version checks and role checks apply regardless of hidden browser controls. Jobs record an owner; cancellation requires that owner or a supervisor. Workspace reads are shared by authenticated accounts; there is no tenant-isolation claim.

## Sessions

`FLEET_AUTHENTICATION_MODE=session` uses Argon2 password hashes through pwdlib and opaque random server-side sessions. Only SHA-256 session-token hashes are stored. Cookies are HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, scoped to `/api`, and Secure in production. Sessions expire after eight hours by default. Mutations require the returned CSRF token and an allowed Origin. Login origin checks, per-account lockout after five failures for fifteen minutes, and proxy login rate limits are implemented. Logout deletes the server session; disabling/resetting an account prevents its previous sessions being used.

`GET/POST/DELETE /api/access/session` provide identity, login and logout. The browser keeps the CSRF token in memory and returns to sign-in after session expiry. Provision/reset an account using `scripts/provision_user.py` with a configured database and the installable backend package; passwords are prompted twice, require fourteen characters, and never appear in arguments or logs. Provisioning resets sessions and adds an audit event.

## Optional self-registration

`FLEET_ALLOW_SIGNUP` defaults to false. When explicitly enabled with session
authentication, `GET /api/access/registration` advertises signup and `POST` creates
an account with an allowed Origin. Account IDs are normalized to lowercase and
must contain 3–64 ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores or hyphens, starting
with a letter or digit. Display names are trimmed and passwords require 14–256
characters. Duplicate account IDs return 409 and never reset an existing account.
Passwords are Argon2 hashes; registration is audited without credentials.

Every self-registered account has the **viewer** role. Role input is rejected.
Registration does not create a session: the user signs in after success. An
administrator provisions additional roles separately. Viewers can read the
shared synthetic workspace; no record/tenant isolation or email verification is
claimed. The EC2 HTTPS proxy limits signup POSTs to five per minute per source IP
with a burst of three. AWS demonstration signup is enabled by its compose overlay.

`demo` mode reads `X-Demo-User` and `X-Demo-Role` for labelled local fixtures only. Session mode ignores these headers. Production settings reject demo authentication, insecure cookies, automatic schema creation/seeding, non-PostgreSQL storage and non-HTTPS origins.

Audit records retain actors, UTC timestamps, versions and reasons for material changes. These controls do not establish regulatory certification or aircraft maintenance authority.

Customer-trial `/demo` routes require local development/demo authentication or the explicit `tunnel_demo` environment with server sessions. Production still rejects them. Tunnel mode requires a separate `fleet_public_demo` PostgreSQL database, secure cookies, explicit HTTPS origins and explicit migrations/bootstrap. It cannot use header identities. `FLEET_COOKIE_SAMESITE=none` permits the cross-site Pages experiment; `strict` is the default and production setting. Cookie blocking still applies to `none`; Pages uses the complete-app origin for reliable sessions. Trial creation/planning requires planner or supervisor. Assessments, delivery outcomes, approval and work retain their existing engineer/logistics/supervisor checks. Offline model installation uses administrator registration; a customer cannot upload executable model weights. Actions in the guided customer trial mutate only its dedicated synthetic records.

## Release scope — 2026-10-05

Administrator additionally configures operational resources; planner/supervisor submits exact-plan comparisons. Authentication scopes one isolated agency installation: all authenticated accounts share its read workspace; job cancellation retains owner/supervisor authorization. `deployment_scope` rejects shared multi-agency mode. Selected ASVS 5.0.0 controls and remaining security-assessment limits are mapped in `docs/operations/security_review.md`.

## Fleet-health workspace decisions

The fleet-health screens follow one decision flow, and the API enforces each step: engineers confirm or dismiss findings; supervisors (and planners) schedule work orders; logistics reserves, orders or receives parts requests; fleet managers run scenarios. Supervisors may act at every step. In local demo mode the role chosen in the top bar is sent as `X-Demo-Role`; signed-in accounts keep their server role.
